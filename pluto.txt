Venus doesn't know. I am wracked with guilt. My whole life was destroyed when I left Mars for Venus, yet here I find myself again. Am I broken? Is love real? Do we simply create this feeling within our own minds as a veil agaisnt the harsh shredding reality? We believe it to be so solid. Like an object, so real we could hold it. But when I see Pluto, my love for Venus crumbles like a dream at the moment of waking, as though it never existed. Was it ever real? Am I real? Is Pluto?
